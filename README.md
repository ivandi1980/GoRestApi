### GoRestApi

This is a Simple Rest Api using `go` with `sqlite3`

notes : if you have any errors when you run : `go run main.go` The solution for Windows User just `Install mingw` by typing `choco install -y mingw`.

but if you don't have any `Choco installed` on your `windows machine`, so you can installing it by open your `cmd` as `Administrator` and paste this code `@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"`

hope it can help you
